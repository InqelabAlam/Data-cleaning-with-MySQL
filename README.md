# 🧹 Data Cleaning with MySQL

Hello everyone! This is my first data cleaning project using **MySQL**. In this project, I demonstrate the essential steps involved in cleaning a raw dataset to make it analysis-ready.

## 🗂️ Project Overview
Data cleaning is a foundational step in the data analysis process. Inaccurate or messy data can lead to misleading insights, so it's important to detect and correct issues such as:
- Duplicates
- Null or missing values
- Inconsistent formatting
- Incorrect data types

This project focuses on cleaning a dataset containing company layoff data using MySQL queries.

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand and practice data cleaning techniques using SQL
- Apply transformations to improve data quality
- Prepare the dataset for further analysis or visualization

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- Subqueries
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Data type conversion
- Handling null values
- Removing duplicates

## 🔍 Key Cleaning Steps
1. Removed duplicate records
2. Handled missing and null values
3. Standardized column formats (e.g., dates, text)
4. Fixed inconsistent company names
5. Changed data types for consistency

## ✅ Outcome
The cleaned dataset is now consistent, complete, and ready for further analysis, dashboard creation, or reporting.
