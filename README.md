# Data-cleaning-with-MySQL
Hello everybody. Checkout my data cleaning project with MySQL. 
Here I showcase the codes required to properly clean data to make it useable
by detecting and correcting inaccurate, incomplete, duplicate or irrelevant data from a dataset.
Cleaning the data is the primary and most important step in data analysis.
This makes sure the data does not give us misleading results.
